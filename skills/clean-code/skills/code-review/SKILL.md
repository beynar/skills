  This skill should be used when the user asks to "review code", "review this file",
  "audit code quality", "clean up AI-generated code", "detect slop", "scan for anti-patterns",
  "refactor messy code", "check for over-engineering", "is this code clean", "find issues",
  "too complex", "simplify this", "code smell", or says "the AI wrote this and it's messy".
  It reviews AI-generated TypeScript/Node.js code for 14 anti-pattern categories (unnecessary
  abstractions, monoliths, silent failures, dead code, performance traps, hallucinated APIs)
  and produces a structured review report with a cleaned rewrite. Also triggers when the user
  wants to check code before merging a PR or wants a second opinion on AI-generated output.

# Clean Code — AI Code Review Toolkit

A skill collection for reviewing, diagnosing, and cleaning AI-generated TypeScript/Node.js code. Built to be the second-pass reviewer that catches what AI coding agents consistently get wrong.

## Why This Exists

AI coding agents (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, Codex) produce predictable failure patterns. CodeRabbit measured 1.7x more issues in AI-generated PRs. GitClear found code duplication up 8x. Augment Code documented that 1 in 5 AI samples reference fake libraries. The code works, but the review bottleneck is real.

This skill turns an AI into a senior reviewer that enforces taste, structure, and correctness — so you can delegate the review, not just the writing.

## When to Use

- After an AI agent writes or modifies code and you want it reviewed
- When code feels "sloppy" but you can't pinpoint why
- Before merging AI-generated PRs
- When you want a quick quality scan before deeper review
- When you want mechanical cleanup applied without discussion

## Three Modes

This skill collection contains three specialized sub-skills. Choose based on what you need:

### 1. Code Review (report + rewrite)
**Trigger**: "review this code", "review this file", "audit this", "check code quality"

Full structured review with severity-ranked issues, line numbers, explanations, and a cleaned rewrite. Two outputs: the report and the fixed code.

See: `references/code-review.md`

### 2. Slop Detector (diagnosis only)
**Trigger**: "scan for slop", "detect anti-patterns", "quick quality check", "how bad is this"

Fast diagnostic scan producing a severity table and a slop score (1-10). No rewrite — just a clear diagnosis with a recommendation (ship it / quick cleanup / needs full review / consider rewriting).

See: `references/slop-detector.md`

### 3. Code Cleanup (rewrite only)
**Trigger**: "clean up this code", "fix this file", "strip the slop", "simplify this"

Mechanical cleanup: 9 ordered passes (dead code → flatten nesting → inline abstractions → naming → comments → silent failures → duplicates → performance → imports). No report — just the cleaned code with `// REVIEW:` flags where human judgment is needed.

See: `references/code-cleanup.md`

## The 13 Anti-Pattern Categories

Organized by severity, grounded in measured data:

### Critical (must fix)

| # | Category | What It Catches | Source |
|---|----------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | **Trojan Output** | Silent failures, fake output, removed safety checks | IEEE Spectrum 2026 |
| 2 | **Error Amnesia** | Swallowed errors, empty catches, inconsistent handling | CodeRabbit (2x gap) |
| 3 | **Walking Dead** | Unused imports, variables, functions, commented-out blocks | GitClear 2025 |
| 4 | **Phantom Import** | Hallucinated APIs, deprecated methods, nonexistent packages | Augment (1 in 5) |

### Important (should fix)

| # | Category | What It Catches | Source |
|---|----------|----------------|--------|
| 5 | **Phantom Abstractions** | Wrappers, singletons, Context Bags, passthrough generators | Practitioner consensus |
| 6 | **Monolith Instinct** | Entire workflows in one function; bad decomposition when forced | Practitioner consensus |
| 7 | **Prophetic Engineering** | Solving hypothetical future problems, ceremony interfaces | Practitioner consensus |
| 8 | **Clone Army** | Duplicated logic instead of reuse | GitClear (8x increase) |
| 9 | **Leaky Delegation** | Subservice logic inlined/duplicated in parent class | Practitioner consensus |
| 10 | **Speed Trap** | O(n^2) loops, N+1 queries, sequential awaits | CodeRabbit (8x I/O) |
| 11 | **Nesting Instinct** | Deep control flow that should be flat | Agile Pain Relief (39%) |
| 12 | **Identity Crisis** | Vague naming that hides intent | CodeRabbit (2x) |
| 13 | **Type System Cosplay** | TypeScript features used for complexity, not safety | Practitioner consensus |

### Minor (consider fixing)

| # | Category | What It Catches | Source |
|---|----------|----------------|--------|
| 14 | **Comment Theater** | Comments that restate the code or contradict it | Practitioner consensus |

## Conventions Enforced

- **Early returns**: Guard clauses first. No deep nesting for happy paths.
- **Single responsibility**: One function = one job. One file = one cohesive concern.
- **Coherence over length**: No arbitrary line limits. A 400-line file is fine if it's one concern.
- **Naming**: Verb-first for actions (`getUser`), nouns for data (`activeUsers`), prefixed booleans (`isReady`).
- **Comments**: Top-of-method on non-trivial exports. Purpose + rationale + non-obvious decisions. Never restate the code.
- **Imports**: Remove unused. Don't question dependency choices.
- **Decomposition**: When splitting monoliths — one class per responsibility, parent passes `this` to children, no ceremony types, no intermediate interfaces unless child is independently reusable.

## Rules Reference

Each anti-pattern category has a dedicated rule file in `rules/` with detailed signals, diagnostic tests, and before/after examples. The compiled version is in `AGENTS.md`.

| Rule File | Category |
|-----------|----------|
| `rules/trojan-output.md` | Silent failures & fake output |
| `rules/error-amnesia.md` | Error handling anti-patterns |
| `rules/walking-dead.md` | Dead & redundant code |
| `rules/phantom-import.md` | Hallucinated APIs & outdated patterns |
| `rules/phantom-abstractions.md` | Unnecessary abstractions |
| `rules/monolith-instinct.md` | Function & file bloat |
| `rules/prophetic-engineering.md` | Over-engineering |
| `rules/clone-army.md` | Code duplication |
| `rules/leaky-delegation.md` | Separation of concerns violations |
| `rules/speed-trap.md` | Performance anti-patterns |
| `rules/nesting-instinct.md` | Excessive nesting & complexity |
| `rules/identity-crisis.md` | Naming failures |
| `rules/type-cosplay.md` | TypeScript type system abuse |
| `rules/comment-theater.md` | Missing or excessive comments |
