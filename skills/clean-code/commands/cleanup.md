Read the skill at ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/code-cleanup/SKILL.md and follow its instructions.

Apply the 9-pass cleanup pipeline to the code at @$ARGUMENTS. Output the cleaned file directly. No report — just the fixed code with // REVIEW: flags where human judgment is needed. If no file is specified, ask the user which file to clean.
